# Helmet and License Plate Detector

Welcome to the Helmet and License Plate Detector project! This project utilizes YOLOv8, Flask, and OpenCV to detect helmets on people's heads and license plates on vehicles in images or real-time video streams.

## Features
- Object detection: The system accurately detects and classifies helmets and license plates in real-time.
- Real-time performance: Enjoy seamless integration with your application for real-time analysis.

## How I Made It
I developed this project using YOLOv8, a powerful object detection algorithm, Flask for the user interface, and OpenCV for image and video processing.

## Clone Repository
To get started with the Helmet and License Plate Detector, follow these steps:
